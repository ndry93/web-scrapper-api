// Caching Modules are cached after the first time they are loaded.
// This means (among other things) that every call to require('foo') will get exactly the same object returned,
// if it would resolve to the same file.
// Multiple calls to require('foo') may not cause the module code to be executed multiple times.
// This is an important feature. With it, "partially done" objects can be returned,
// thus allowing transitive dependencies to be loaded even when they would cause cycles.
// If you want to have a module execute code multiple times, then export a function, and call that function.
